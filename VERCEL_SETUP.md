# ðŸš€ Vercel Deployment Setup Guide

## Quick Setup for AI Features

### 1. **Environment Variables in Vercel**
Go to your Vercel dashboard â†’ Project Settings â†’ Environment Variables and add:

```
REACT_APP_OPENAI_API_KEY = your_openai_api_key_here
```

**That's it!** The app will work perfectly with just the OpenAI API key.

### 2. **Optional Environment Variables**
If you want real weather/air quality data later, you can add:
```
REACT_APP_WEATHER_API_KEY = your_weather_api_key_here
REACT_APP_AIR_QUALITY_API_KEY = your_air_quality_api_key_here
```

**Note:** Without these, the app uses realistic mock data, so it works perfectly for demos!

### 3. **Deploy**
Your app will automatically deploy when you push to GitHub. The AI features are now live! ðŸŽ‰
