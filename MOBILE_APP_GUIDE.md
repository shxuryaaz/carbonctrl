# CarbonCtrl Mobile App - Installation Guide

## 🎉 Your CarbonCtrl Mobile App is Ready!

I've successfully created a working mobile app for your CarbonCtrl project. Here are the different ways you can use it:

## 📱 Option 1: Install as PWA (Progressive Web App) - RECOMMENDED

This is the easiest and most reliable method:

### Steps:
1. **On your Android device:**
   - Open Chrome or Edge browser
   - Navigate to: `http://YOUR_COMPUTER_IP:8080` (replace with your computer's IP address)
   - Or if testing locally: `http://localhost:8080`

2. **Install the app:**
   - Tap the menu (three dots) in Chrome
   - Select "Add to Home Screen" or "Install App"
   - The app will be added to your home screen like a native app

### Benefits:
- ✅ Works offline after first load
- ✅ Looks and feels like a native app
- ✅ No app store required
- ✅ Automatic updates
- ✅ Full access to all CarbonCtrl features

## 📦 Option 2: Convert to APK using Online Tools

### Files Ready for Conversion:
- `CarbonCtrl-PWA/` - Contains all the web app files
- `CarbonCtrl-Mobile-App.zip` - Ready-to-upload package

### Online APK Builders:
1. **PhoneGap Build** (https://build.phonegap.com/)
   - Upload the zip file
   - Download the APK

2. **Capacitor** (https://capacitorjs.com/)
   - Use the Capacitor setup in `CarbonCtrlCapacitor/`

3. **PWA Builder** (https://www.pwabuilder.com/)

## 🛠️ Option 3: Build APK Locally (Advanced)

If you want to build the APK locally:

npx cap sync android
cd android
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

2. **Mobile Testing:**
   - Find your computer's IP address
   - Connect your phone to the same WiFi network

## 📁 File Structure:

```
carbonctrl/
├── CarbonCtrl-PWA/           # PWA files (ready for deployment)
├── CarbonCtrl-APK/           # APK structure files
├── CarbonCtrl-Mobile-App.zip # Ready-to-upload package
├── CarbonCtrlCapacitor/      # Capacitor setup for local builds

```

## 🎯 Next Steps:

1. **For immediate use:** Install as PWA on your Android device
2. **For distribution:** Use online APK builders to create installable APK
3. **For development:** Use the Capacitor setup for further customization

## 🔧 Troubleshooting:

- **If PWA doesn't install:** Make sure you're using Chrome/Edge and the site is served over HTTPS or localhost
- **If APK doesn't work:** Try the PWA installation method instead
- **If features don't work:** Check that Firebase configuration is correct

## 🎉 Congratulations!

Your CarbonCtrl mobile app is now ready to use! The PWA installation method is recommended as it provides the best user experience and is the most reliable.
